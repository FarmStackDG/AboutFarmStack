# Role of Digital Green

> Digital Green acts as the convener of FarmStack by issuing certificates for member organisations and maintaining the code base with partners. In addition Digital Green provides the necessary services to help discover member organisations, their connectors and the usage policies.

> Digital Green with partners (Precision Agriculture for Development) and CGIAR (IFPRI. CIMMYT) are spearheading use cases to showcase the value of combining data from two or more sources for enabling extension services. The aim of the FarmStack use cases is to provide incremental benefit for the small holder farmers in being able to access timely and contextually relevant advisories.

## Does Digital Green see my data?

> Short answer, absolutely not. FarmStack provisions templates of p2p connectors that can be configured and run by respective organisations on their premise. FarmStack only maintains the discovery of these connectors through their metadata. The data exchange takes place without any third party being involved.

## Does Digital Green provide support in making data shareable?

> As of now, Digital Green does not provide support for cleaning and preparing data. Making data shareable involves significant effort and in many cases is also dependent on the data models which require semantic representation. The philosophy is to enable organisations to come up with these models or leverage existing models and build data transformation services as community driven.

## Does Digital Green provide support in installing connecotrs?

> Yes, the Digital Green will provide support initially in installing and running the connectors on premise. One of the major objectives of FarmStack is to be user friendly so as to enable community adoption with minimal barriers. Digital Green aims to provide support, training and troubleshooting help to enable adoption.

## Is Digital Green providing data on FarmStack?

> Digital Green will provision the data it maintains for government(s) as per the agreed terms in the particular jurisdiction. In this way, the usage policies for further sharing of data will be self imposed in compliance with the evolving data policy. In addition, as per the project requirement data will be available with the requisite usage policies.
