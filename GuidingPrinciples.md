## Guiding principles

- **Sovereignty:** FarmStack is rooted in the principle that data owners should be able to exercise control over the way their data is shared and used by others. FS provides necessary tools that ensure data is accessible to the intended entity for intended purpose.
- **Decentralization:** FarmStack is built on the principles of decentralization thereby providing the necessary edge application in a self-service manner with transparent open source repository.
- **Trusted network:** FarmStack acts as a convener of a trusted data exchange ecosystem whereby the data providers and consumers can be sure that they canâ€™t be impersonated by verifying farmstack issued certificates.
- **Security:** FarmStack edge application provides necessary means to encrypt data in transit in a secured tunnel ensuring data cannot be seen by any actor outside the data sharing transactions.
- **Interoperability:** FarmStack provides necessary semantic structure of digital resources (edge applications) which enables users to use the same information model and avoid lock in.
- **Discoverability:** FarmStack is to provide discoverability of the necessary digital resources and their metadata that includes ownership and usage restrictions details.
