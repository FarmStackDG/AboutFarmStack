### What is FarmStack?
FarmStack is a digital infrastructure that enables data collaboration between different entities. It does this by providing a means to:
1. Share data directly to the relevant organization without the need of third party through p2p connector (peer to peer connector) 
2. Empower the data provider to specify how data can or cannot be used by the receiver through data owner defined usage policies
3. Enable organizations to make their data discoverable by publishing metadata (description of connectors and usage policies) and shareable through data interface containers

### Why is FarmStack required?
FarmStack is required because:
*  Lack of trust on misuse or under utilization of data for centralized data repository
*  Need to comply with evolving data policy and privacy safeguarding measures

### Value generated by FarmStack
* By combining specific datasets, better services or products can be created
* Potential to unlock value of data that was previously considered not shareable
* More the feedback from farmers is combined, more enriching the solution can be - giving rise to virtuous cycle

### How does someone use FarmStack

Business roles in FS can be viewed as layered operational spheres:
* __FS Participants__ : These are stakeholders who are actually performing data exchange or providing some services for data exchange. This is mainly a data provider and data consumer
* __FS Central/ Steward__ : This is a nodal agency/ consortium who will run farmstack in that geography/ jurisdiction. They will operate the gateways for the participants. Examples could be MoA or a global consortium.
* __FS Core__: This is the technology stack that is maintained by DG and consortium based on IDS technology stack (Fraunhofer) which consists of the code repo under MIT/ Apache license. They will own the master services agreement - governance structure and the right to provision instance of FS central.

#### Example:
Consider the diagram, there are two instances of FS run by two independent central bodies in different jurisdictions. Let us say MoA of Country1 and Country2 run separate instances of FarmStack C1 and C2 which have participants P1â€¦ Pn who do data exchange between each other. By provisioning FS, C1 and C2 run FS on their server in addition to managing the organizations.
